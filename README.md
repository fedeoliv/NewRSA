# NewRSA
This repository is for one of my studies related to Number Theory and Cryptography.
NewRSA is basically a modification in RSA algorithm, using the concept of large gaps between primes.

I highly recommend you to read my paper to help you understand better what I am trying to do here.
Unfortunately my paper is written in Portuguese right now, but I`ll publish it in English when I have more time.

<b>tests:</b>Folder containing some C++ and Octave files for testing some prime estimates, without considering the cryptography itself.
<b>newRSA:</b>Folder containing C++ files for testing the RSA cryptography with the concept of large prime gaps.

The code may have some bugs and can be improved of course. If you want to work on it with me, would be a pleasure :)
